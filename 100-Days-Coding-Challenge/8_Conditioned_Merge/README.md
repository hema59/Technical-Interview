Given two arrays of ints that are sets, create a function to merge them to create a new set.

A set must pass on these three conditions:

- All values are positive, delete negative numbers

- Sorted

- Non-duplicates

Extra :
how would you merge two sorted arrays provided not to use a third array nor u can allocate extra space. try to optimize the problem to the best. time complexity should be less than O(n^2)

Extra Extra : 
 Write a function that takes input as two linked lists , which are basically integers represented in linked list format and calculate sum.
