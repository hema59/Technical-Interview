Given two arrays of ints that are sets, create a function to merge them to create a new set.

A set must pass on these three conditions:

- All values are positive

- Sorted

- Non-duplicates

Extra :
how would you merge two sorted arrays provided not to use a third array nor u can allocate extra space. try to optimize the problem to the best. time complexity should be less than O(n^2)
