Write a function int Compare_Strings(char* str1, char* str2){...} such that the function returns +1, -1 or 0 based on whether str1 is LEXICOGRAPHICALLY greater, smaller or equal to
str2; the comparison should be case-insensitive. For example: "abc" is smaller than "mno" as 'a's ASCII value is less than 'm's. However, "ABC" and "abc" are equal.
Also discuss the test-cases.
