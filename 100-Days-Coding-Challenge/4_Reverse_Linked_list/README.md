How do you reverse the words in a linked list?

For ex, Convert " H-e-l-l-o- -W-o-r-l-d " (There is a space between the word), into " o-l-l-e-H- -d-l-r-o-W "

Write a code to use as less Space Complexity as possible. (So not too many spaces should be used)

Extra : How would you find if a linked list has a loop? How would you do it without using additional memory, if the linked list is sorted.
