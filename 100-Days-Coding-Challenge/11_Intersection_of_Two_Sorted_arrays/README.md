Given 2 sorted array print their intersection.

Extra :Given two Arrays, there is intersection of elements in these two arrays. So now find all the elements which are common in both these arrays.

Suppose there is an element '#' repeated 2 times in both the arrays, then in the output we need to show two '#'s

Example 1 :

Array 1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], Array 2 = [0,9,10,4,5]

Result = [4,5]

Example 2 :

Array 1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,6,6,7], Array 2 = [0,6,9,10,6,4,6,5]

Result = [4,5,6,6,6]
